## DMCA Reports and Copyright ##
We understand that your copyrighted assets and other intellectual property are important to your business. We would like to facilitate any requests you may have, however we would like you keep in mind the following:
 - OpenSprites is mainly used by young children. 
 - OpenSprites was created with the intent of being an educational resource sharing site.
 - The users are not very likely to do harm to your brand or business - this is a low scale site and a child's school project is unlikely to cause a drop in your profits.
 
If you still feel it is necessary to file a DMCA Report you may go ahead, and we reserve the right to publish your report at [chillingeffects.org](http://chillingeffects.org).
