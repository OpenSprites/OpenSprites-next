However, in order to upload content to the website, an OpenSprites account must be created. During the creation of an account, we ask you to provide your existing Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) username and a valid email address. We ask that you do not include information that could personally identify you. OpenSprites does not have access to any account creation information collected by Scrath, such as your gender, date of birth and email address.
