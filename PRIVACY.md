## Information we collect about you

### Information you submit to us

#### Creating an account
[OpenSprites](/) allows all visitors to download whatever content they wish from the website without restriction. However, in order to upload content to the website, an OpenSprites account must be created. During the creation of an account, we ask you to provide your existing [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) username and a valid email address. We ask that you do not include information that could personally identify you. OpenSprites does not have access to any account creation information collected by Scratch, such as your gender, date of birth and email address.

#### Uploading a resource
When you submit a resource to OpenSprites, we remember the date and time it was uploaded, the username and user ID number of the uploader, along with the file name you specify on the upload page. If you do not specify a file name, the original file name is used, unless the file is a Scratch script or originated from a Scratch project file. We keep this information so other users can search for your file quickly. Images encoded in modern formats carry metadata (known as EXIF data), such as capture device make and model, image capture settings and occasionally location data. The inclusion of location data is subject to the capture device. Some cameras and mobile phones equipped with GPS units will include this data automatically; consult your manufacturer for further details. All images uploaded to OpenSprites have their metadata deleted immediately; however, we cannot be held responsible for any errors during this process.

### Information we collect automatically

#### IP address and user agent
Requests sent from your browser to the OpenSprites website are sent along with a set of numbers which uniquely identify your network. This is standard practice for the whole internet; the inclusion of your IP address allows the web server to respond and return the requested information to the correct location. We record all requests made to OpenSprites in a log. Information such as your IP address, browser and operating system version (user agent), and requested webpage are all saved to the log. This allows us to investigate and prevent abuse of our services by blocking access from specific networks.

### Information we place on your system

#### Cookies
A cookie is a small and harmless piece of text used commonly by websites to identify users. We use cookies to keep users logged in as they navigate the website and for preventing the need to log-in again for returning users. In addition, we use cookies to prevent showing users a notice more than once.
